## About
I recently graduated from the CS Ph.D. program at UC Berkeley where I worked with [Yun S. Song](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/). I am broadly interested in developing methods in statistical machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and experimental design as well as its real-world applications, in particular, I have worked on biology, healthcare, and forecasting in the past. 

During my Ph.D, I had the good fortune of working with many fantastic mentors during internships. I worked with [Ali Bashir](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RfnRk4kAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Google Accelerated Sciences](https://research.google/teams/applied-science/gas/) on machine learning algorithms for genomics. Prior to that, I worked with [Andy Miller](https://andymiller.github.io/) and [Emily Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ebfox/) on the [Apple Health AI](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research?page=1&tag=Health) team. Lastly, I worked with [Lawrence Murray](https://www.indii.org/) at Uber AI Labs where I worked on Bayesian online learning methods for time series. Prior to Berkeley, I received an M.Eng in Computer Science from MIT and a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from MIT. I was funded by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
